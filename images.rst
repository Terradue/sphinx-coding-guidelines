Inline images
+++++++++++++

Placing an image inline is done defining the image with:

  .. |run_process_button| image:: assets/run_process_button.png
    :width: 100pt
    :height: 20pt


.. |run_process_button| image:: assets/run_process_button.png
  :width: 100pt
  :height: 20pt

And click |run_process_button| to submit the processing. Monitor its progress.
